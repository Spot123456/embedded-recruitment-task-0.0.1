Step 1: Open the GitHub Editor
Go to your GitHub repository's README.md file:
https://github.com/Spot123456/embedded-recruitment-task-0.0.1/edit/main/README.md

This will open the GitHub file editor.

Step 2: Replace the Existing Content
Delete all the existing content in the README.md file.

Copy the updated README.md content I provided earlier (scroll up to find it).

Paste the new content into the GitHub editor.

Step 3: Commit the Changes
Scroll down to the Commit changes section at the bottom of the page.

Add a commit message, such as:

Copy
Updated README.md with detailed documentation
Optionally, add a description if needed.

Select Commit directly to the main branch.

Click the green Commit changes button.

Step 4: Verify the Changes
Go back to your repository's main page:
https://github.com/Spot123456/embedded-recruitment-task-0.0.1

Verify that the README.md now displays the updated content.

Optional: Add Badges
If you want to add badges (e.g., for build status, license, etc.), you can include them at the top of the README.md. For example:

# 🚀 Multithreaded Rust Server

A high-performance, multithreaded server implemented in Rust using the `threadpool` crate. This project includes a server, client, and test suite to demonstrate efficient client-server communication using Protocol Buffers.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: Latest stable version recommended. Install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager, included with Rust.
- **Protocol Buffers**: Ensure `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler) is installed. Follow the [official guide](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spot123456/embedded-recruitment-task-0.0.1/multithreaded_server.git
cd multithreaded_server
2. Build the Project
Compile the project using Cargo:

bash
Copy
cargo build
3. Run the Server
Start the server by running:

bash
Copy
cargo run
The server will start listening on localhost:8080. You should see logs like this:

Copy
[INFO] Server is running on localhost:8080
4. Run the Test Suite
To verify the server's functionality, run the test suite:

bash
Copy
cargo test -- --nocapture
The --nocapture flag ensures that test logs are displayed in the terminal. You should see output like this:

Copy
running 1 test
[INFO] Starting test_client_echo_message...
[INFO] Creating server...
[INFO] Starting server thread...
[INFO] Connecting client to server...
[INFO] Connected to the server!
[INFO] Sending EchoMessage to server...
[INFO] Sent message: EchoMessage { content: "Hello, World!" }
[INFO] Waiting for response from server...
[INFO] Received 12 bytes from server.
[INFO] Received EchoMessage from server: Hello, World!
[INFO] Disconnecting client...
[INFO] Disconnected from the server!
[INFO] Stopping server...
[INFO] Shutdown signal sent.
[INFO] Joining server thread...
[INFO] Server stopped.
[INFO] Test completed successfully!
test test_client_echo_message ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
5. Connecting a Client
The client implementation in client.rs can be used to connect to the server. Modify the client code as needed to send messages to the server.

🧩 Features
Multithreaded Server: Uses a thread pool to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

Protocol Buffers: Messages are encoded and decoded using Protocol Buffers for efficient communication.

Test Suite: Includes tests to verify server functionality and client-server communication.

Logging: Uses the log and env_logger crates for structured logging.

📦 Dependencies
This project uses the following Rust crates:

log: For logging messages.

env_logger: For initializing the logger.

prost: For encoding and decoding messages using Protocol Buffers.

threadpool: For creating a thread pool to handle client connections.

prost-build: For generating Rust code from Protocol Buffers definitions.

📝 Notes
The server is designed to handle multiple clients concurrently using a thread pool.

The test suite includes a basic test (test_client_echo_message) to verify that the server echoes messages correctly.

You can extend the server and client to support additional message types and functionality.
